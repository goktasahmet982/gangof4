I created a webpage of the second largest city of Turkey for the final project. It has Home, About, Where to go? and Contact futures on Navbar. It is also compatible for mobile devices.

I used "Home" feature to show common picture of the most beautiful side of the city to make the webpage interesting for someone who visits.

I have "About" feature to adress general information and the history of the city.

I have "Where to go?" feature to show touristic and most beautiful places in and out of the town for the people who would like to visit.

I have "Contact" feature for the poeple who would like to get more information or for any other reasons.

I used bootstrap,Css,Html to create the webpage. I added automatic carousel to show visitors nicest places around.I put container and column features to show other brances.
